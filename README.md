This project is based on the YOLO algorithm. The objects visibility detection system is used to identify the amount of percentage an object can be visible to the system in some coordinate. This system will detects the humans, animals, vehicles.

## Problem statement 
Recently, the percentage of accidents has been rapidly increasing. There may be different reasons for thiese accidents. but the main reason of this accidents is the unvisibility of the other objects in the road while they are dribing. This system will identify and give information to the driver of a vehicleabout the closeness of the objects infornt hi.
## About the project0
This project will identify the objects that are infront the particular person. This system is mainly useful for reducing the accidents, traffic flow control,unnecessary stopings. 

## Technical implemntaion 
- The visibility detection system is mainly useful in identifying the closeness of an object toother objects.
- At first we have selected the project to reduce the accidents causes.
- I set up the googlr drive
- upload the video
- running the output and getting the final results.
