This project is based on the YOLO algorithm. The objects visibility detection system is used to identify the amount of percentage an object can be visible to the system in some coordinate. This system will detects the humans, animals, vehicles.

## Problem statement 
Recently, the percentage of accidents has been rapidly increasing. There may be different reasons for thiese accidents. but the main reason of this accidents is the unvisibility of the other objects in the road while they are dribing. This system will identify and give information to the driver of a vehicleabout the closeness of the objects infornt hi.
## About the project
This project will identify the objects that are infront the particular person. This system is mainly useful for reducing the accidents, traffic flow control,unnecessary stopings. 

## Technical implemntaion 
- The visibility detection system is mainly useful in identifying the closeness of an object toother objects.
- At first we have selected the project to reduce the accidents causes.
- I set up the googlr drive
- upload the video
- running the output and getting the final results.

## Techstacks used 
`opencv` , `yolo ` , `ml`

## How to run locally 
1.Mount google drive first for a storage and GPU
2.Clone Darknet GitHub repository
3.Go to the darknet folder, enable GPU, then compile the entire thing
4.Get the YOLO Weights file
5.get the working Directory
6.upload the input video
7.Get the output video with accuracy and  detected objects.
# What's next ?
We are trying to implement the visibility identification for objects like trees, plants, polls and some other objects.
## Declaration
We confirm that the project showcased here was either developed entirely during the hackathon or underwent significant updates within the hackathon timeframe. We understand that if any plagiarism from online sources is detected, our project will be disqualified, and our participation in the hackathon will be revoked.
